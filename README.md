# facial_expression_recogntion
This is an implementation for facial expression recognition using the fer2013 data from kaggle

link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013 or https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013

Multiple attepmpts were made to improve CNN architecture, for effective facial expression recognition and the final architecture gives an accuracy of 84%

The model developed using the final CNN architecture is available in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1igHQBEIUtPOBBTJ3N_zjkp8t3ghUoldI/view?usp=sharing
